In DGM 3780 we will be using automated tests and bulild processes to check code.

#Steps
1. Fork this Assignment Repo to your Github repo
2. Clone this Repo to your desktop (from YOUR github account)
3. Complete the assigned coding tasks as listed below :computer: :smile:
4. Commit often to your local repo
5. Push to your Github repo
6. Submit Pull Request to the Assignment Repo

Here is a short and sweet tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/

Thats it! When you submit your Pull Request, an automatic build process will be kicked off to run the tests and check your code. You can see the results of this within the pull request.

#Assignment
For this assignment you will be practicing this process. After you clone the repo, open up the aboutme.js file and constuct a Javascript object with the fallowing properties.

name (String)

gender (String)

interests (Array, at least 3 elements)

bio (String, length greater than 140.)

##Tips
-Don't forget to:
````npm install````
when you first clone a project,

-Want to know how you are doing while coding before you push?

Run:
````npm test````
In your terminal to know if you are going to pass the tests or not.
