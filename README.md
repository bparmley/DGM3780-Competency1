#Steps
1. Fork Assignment Repo
2. Clone Repo to your desktop (from YOUR github account)
3. Code! :computer: :smile:
4. Commit often
5. Push to github
6. Submit Pull Request

Here is a short and sweet tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/

Thats it! When you submit your Pull Request, an automatic build process will be kicked off to run the tests and check your code. You can see the results of this within the pull request.
