#Steps

3. Code! :computer: :smile:
4. Commit often
5. Push to github
6. Submit Pull Request

Here is a short and sweet tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/

Thats it! When you submit your Pull Request, an automatic build process will be kicked off to run the tests and check your code. You can see the results of this within the pull request.

##Tips
-Don't forget to:  
````npm install````  
when you first clone a project,  

-Want to know how you are doing while coding?  
Run:  
````npm test````  
In your terminal to know if you are going to pass the tests or not.
